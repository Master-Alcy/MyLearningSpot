# Note

* Debug configuration (drop down menu of debug icon)
  * E:\RiskVal\RVFI_Profile
  * Must have /config, /Data, /log
* Some useful shortcut in eclipse
  * Open Type: ctrl shift T

## Beginner's Note

1. Write a small chunk of code and upload for code review. (pull request)
    1. Don't make tons of code and end up wasting time
    2. Sometimes you won't know a certain things and might mess up in the beginning
2. Write design doc (for end goal)
    1. Make logic clear
    2. Save time maintaining it later
    3. Don't just code for code, keep an eye on the goal and make sure it's the correct way.
    4. Foresee your goal and then code
3. Don't just spending time on random stuff
    1. Make sure you have some goal everyday
4. Don't be a SmartAss
    1. Keep code simple
    2. Respect others' idea
    3. Ask questions and helps if needed
5. Make sure who's tech lead and respect
    1. Probably send code to him and let he submit
    2. Help on some little things
    3. Put tech lead's name on design doc
    
## Notes about design doc

### Things in doc

* Brief description of the problem
* A high-level description of your solution, including **design decisions** and **data structures**
* **Declarations** for all new classes, procedures, and global/class variables
* **Descriptions** of all new procedures (unless you can tell exactly what it does from the name), including the purpose of the procedure, and an explanation of how it works and/or pseudocode
    * precise pseudo code with decisions
* correctness invariants and testing **strategy**
    * testing methodology
    * cases.

### Things should not be in

* No actual code, use pseudo code
* ASSERT and DEBUG are not in pseudo code
