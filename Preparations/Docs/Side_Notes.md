## Some leetcode numbers

I Feel I can get questions from leetcode directly.

1. 13 / 18, 17, 594
2. 458, 141, 13, 447, 183, 159, 75, 74, 62, 437 / 462, 459, 254, 617, 585, 460, 414, 61, 38 / 457, 160, 63

## Questions

1. Subsets
    * Looking at the question: range should be small
    * Time complexity is more than O(n^2), for ex: (2^n, n!, n^n), then should be a polynomial time problem
    * NP problem => search problem (can only be solved by searching)
