# LaiOffer Notes

## Chapter 1

### OOP

1. Everything is an object
    * Each with a type
    * defined by:
        * state: field it maintains. Field affect class
        * behavior: methods it can do
2. class: types should have (hou1ses)
3. object: each one build (each house)
3. reference: address of objects, de-referencing :(
4. primitive type is not objects, all else object
    * no reference, directly stored in memory.
    * no field, no method
5. Student firstStudent = new Student("Tom");
    1. Declaration: Student firstStudent
    2. Instantiation: new keyword to create object, firstStudent is a reference
    3. Initialization: Student("Tom") after new
6. Stack, Heap Memory
    1. Stack: A reference of reference of reference
    2. Heap: Dynamic Objects, All Objects. Object may have reference.
7. Object jack = object rose => reference change
8. ClassName, variableName. One public class per .java. Class id is just name and type. Order matters, but don't design like that.
9. Null. empty reference.
10. final class (no derived), final method (no overridden), final field (no assigned again).
11. Static: 
    * members belong to class, not object (instance)

## Chapter 2

### params passing

1. java, always pass by value
    * primitive type: copy of value itself
    * objects: copy of the object reference 
        * note, copy reference means created a new reference to the same object
2. array's elements are occupying consecutive(continuous) memory, Object
    * in stack is a reference to array, memory is in heap
    * array is encapsulation inside JVM, Arrays is not array
    * int[][], default of int[] is null, int[]>[]< is 0.
